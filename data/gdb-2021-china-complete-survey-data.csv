CHN,China,Governance,GOVERNANCE,G.GOVERNANCE.DPL,Governance (G): Data protection,Primary,G.GOVERNANCE.DPL,"To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for protection of personal data?",1,response,,,,,33.300000000000004,G.GOVERNANCE.DPL,0.0,50948,0.1,0.03,0.2,Open Data China,Eastern Asia,South and East Asia
CHN,China,Governance,GOVERNANCE,G.GOVERNANCE.DPL,Governance (G): Data protection,Primary,G.GOVERNANCE.DPL,"To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for protection of personal data?",1,justification,"China currently has no single law in effective providing an comprehensive framework regulating personal information protection yet though the ""Personal Information Protection Law"" (1) has been drafted for public consultation for two rounds during 2020-2021 and a third and final draft is expected to be reviewed in August 2021 and is expected to be passed within 2021. 

In addition to the ""Personal Information Protection Law"", the framework on personal information protection has been dramatically developed in recent years especially during the period from 2016 to 2021. The ""CyberSecurity law""  effective in 2017 (2), ""Information Security Technology — Personal Information Security Specification""(3) effective in 2020 and  ""Civil Code"" (4) effective in 2021 as well as other fragmented sector-specific or issue-specific regulations, guidelines and specifications all together already make a robust and strong framework for personal information protection. The Cybersecurity Law sets out the legal principles and high-level requirements on protection of personal data collected and / or processed via the networks operators.  And the Article 111 of the Civil Code sets out the basic principle that natural person's personal data shall be protected by law; any organization and individuals must collect personal data after obtaining the personal data subject's consent and conduct the collection according to the law; they shall ensure the security of the personal data collected; illegal collection, using, processing and transmitting of others' personal data, illegal transaction of selling / purchasing personal data, and illegal provision / disclosure of personal data shall be prohibited.

Key elements of Personal Information Protection are discussed below:

- Choice and consent: The Civil Code Chapter 6 ""Privacy and Personal Information Protection"" layouts the general foundation and guidelines for personal information processing stating that first an individual must be well informed of the purposes and procedures of processing personal information and second an explicit consent must be obtained to legally process personal information . The Cybersecurity law (Article 41) and the draft of Personal Information Protection Law (Article 13) also provides similar statements. The Article 17 of the drafted Personal Information Protection Law also empowers the individual to access to service even without giving any consent to process personal information whenever it's possible.

Above frameworks also layouts exceptions for consent if allowed by relevant laws and regulations : for instance under the condition of a national security or public health emergency case, or  news report that is relevant to public interest.
- Access and correction: The Civil Code Article 1037 empowers people the right to access and copy own personal information and has the right to correct and ask to delete information. The draft of Personal Information Protection Law specifies the data subject's right to access and correct own information. The article 44-45 grants the data subject's the right to know what information is held by the data handler and has the right to access. The article 46-47 empowers the data subject to correct and even delete relevant personal information. 
- Responsibilities on data holders:
[a] taking steps to ensure personal information is updated and accurate; 
The Article 8 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law states a general principle for personal information processing that high data quality is required so data should be accurate and up-to-date to avoid any possible negative impact on personal rights. 
[b] limiting access to personal data in accordance with its intended use; 
The Article 14 of the draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that the data holder must re-obtain consent if the purpose of collecting and using personal information has been changed. Article 22 further requires that the data holder should be responsible for limiting the data access and use if the third party is contracted to process personal information.
[c] only transferring data to third-parties if there are assurances they will also respect data protection rights
Article 23-24 requires that if transferring data to third-parties is necessary then the transfer should be agreed with the data subject and the third parties should process data under the original agreed purpose. If it is necessary to change the purpose of use, then new consent must be obtained. 
[d] destroying or anonymising data after it is no longer needed for its original intended use.
Article 47 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holder should proactively delete personal information if it is no longer needed for its original intended use.
- Rights of redress:
The Article 68 and 69 of draft Personal Information Protection Law empowers individual to ask compensation if personal informoation processing leads to any negative impact on the individual. In the case of multiple individuals or a collective are affected,  then relevant agency or authority has the right to sue the data holder on behalf of the group of individuals. 
The independent oversight however is only limited to the designated authority while there is no specific Articles encourage civic society orgnaization to provide independent oversight. 
- Breach notification:
The Article 56 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires that data holder should report the breach immediately to the individual and relevant agency and explain what information are breached and possible negative impact and consequences, why and how the information are breached, what has been done to minimize the negative impact and what actions are suggested to the impacted individuals.
The similar requirements were also covered by the Article 42 of Cybersecurity law, the section 10.2 of Personal Information Security Specification and Article 1038 of Civil Code.
- Location data:
The location-related data is covered in the definition of what is personal information. The Civil law defined personal information includes personal location history information. 
- Algorithmic decision-making:
The Article 55 of draft Personal Information Protection Law  requires that data holders should conduct risk assessment  before employing any algorithmic decision making and keep assessment records for at least three years. 
The Article 25 of draft Personal Information Protection Law requires the transparency and fairness of decision made by algorithmic system. It further empowers individuals to receive alternative decisions not based upon personal information,  seek explanation and refuse any decisions solely made by algorithmic system.

Regarding policy and legal frameworks, the fact is there is no nation-wide open data specific framework yet but local governments already made some efforts on making such frameworks. For instance, Guiyang is the pionner making the very first open data related policy but Shanghai's local open data framework (2) sets out the foundation for other local governments to adopt and localize. At least, there are 8 local governments make such framework for open data but there are also more than 30 local governmnents has framework on governing public data or governemnt data which also include sections on open data.(1)

Usually the local commission for economy and informatizatiaon or the designated  Big Data Bureau is responsible for making the framework and enforcing it. The frameworks across china in common define open data as ""raw, reusable and machine readable data"" but categorize government data or public data into unconditonal open data, conditional open data and closed data which is significantly different from what is defined in the west (2). All local frameworks introduce mechanism to annually monitor and assess the implementation of open data across local departments but the level of enforcement varies

CHN,China,Governance,GOVERNANCE,G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING,Governance (G): Data sharing frameworks,Primary,G.GOVERNANCE.DATASHARING,"To what extent do relevant laws, regulations, policies, and guidance provide a comprehensive framework for data sharing?",1,justification,"China has made long-term efforts on data sharing covering wide range of practices including G2G, G2B, B2G and B2B.
First, about G2G, it is strongly encouraged to share data within government systems including within same department but also across departments in order to improve efficiency of governance and stimulate potential innovative uses. Since the introduction of Big Data to China in 2013, the Chinese government at national level pushes data sharing within gov with the release of Action Outline for Promoting the Development of Big Data (1) and the release of the Interim Measures for the Administration of Sharing of Government Information Resources (2). The G2G data sharing practice was dramatically improved and encouraged by the establishment of national government data sharing platform. By 2020, there are over 640K rows of and  1200 API listed on the platform. The data sharing services for particular verification or query purpose s(i.e. Verify identify of an individual based upon the input of name, ID num and phone num or query whether a given individual is married.) have reached over 0.175 billion times a month(3). At local level, Guizhou was the first local government making own local policy framwork on regulating public-sector data including a section on enforcing the data sharing within the government. Following Guiyang, local governments ranging from province-level to city or county-level made own policies on public-sector data. By 2020, at least 30 province-level governments  (total 34 in China) has such frameworks (4). In practice the movement of ""一网通办"" (all public service through one website) strongly accelerates the implementation of data sharing within gov and makes the impact and result of data sharing much more tangible.
Second, about G2B, the data flow from government to business is generally covered by open data policies in China. Especially after the redefinition of open data in 2019, the G2B data flow are well-covered by the local open data frameworks. Since 2021, as the national government defines data as the new production factor, data exchange (exchanging data product or service through free market) is also considered as a way to share government data in a form of product or service . In addition to open data framework, public-funded research data are shared with the public under the regulation on scientific data management(5). The national government also funds 20 scientific data sharing platform to share public-funded scientific data (6)
Third, B2G data sharing already took place in China and there is a new trend in setting a governance framework to well-govern such B2G data sharing practices and re-balance power shift to big platforms. In 2015, the national government issued an opinion on leveraging big data to strengthen the services and supervision over market entities (7). It was the first time the national government formally introduced a two-way data sharing principle instead of just one-way data sharing (G2B). In practice,  big e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and Meituan, or dock-less bike sharing platforms such as OfO or Mobike already shared own data with governments to fill in the gap of statistics (8) or help improve governance (9).
Finally, B2B data sharing already took practice but still lack strong governance framework. For a long term, B2B data sharing may occur in a grey zone and governments at all level took action especially after 2017-2018 period in enforcing law and shut down a lot of companies in sharing or selling data. New B2B data sharing models are under explored including data exchange ,data API and other methods. The action taken by government is to first strengthen the framework on data security in order to set the bottomline of what private sector can not do in terms of data sharing. The recent new laws such as data security law and new discussions on personal information protection as well as cross-border data sharing are all relevant to the B2B data sharing topic. Sector-specific guidance on B2B data sharing is also under exploration(10)

The national government, for the purpose of better managing information resources, has issued set of standard on managing informaiton resources especially on metadata and the creation of repository. 
Regarding with government data, there is no clear national framework yet but at local level or sector-level there are various level of maturity standards are currently in use or under development. There are also different level of methods of pushing forward the standaization. For instance Shanghai has created a city-level standard committee working on standards for public-sector data governance.

However, just as the "" Guiding Opinions of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and China Disabled Persons' Federation on Promoting Information Accessibility""(2) pointed out, China still lacks of a strong legal framework that enforce the information accessibility across sectors and follow clear standards. 

Despite the weakness of the governance framework, in practice China's civil society took initiative to empower and enforce the governments to improve the accessibility of government information infrastructure including websites. In 2013, the China Internet Society started a nation-wide project called  ""China E-Government accessibility initiative"" (3)under the guidance of relevant national departments. The aim of this project is to improve the accessibility of all levels of government websites by 2019.  Instead of directly modifying the websites , the project successfully involved many big corporations to provide technical supports  and tools to allow people with disabilities to leverage those tools to access website without barriers. For instance IFLYTEK may provide text-to-auido service through website plugin.  The project won the ITU's WSIS Champion under the category 2 information and communication infrastructure in 2017(4) for its achievement of improving accessibility on over 1000 government websites.

But there is no planned strategy or consistent training programs at either national level or local level. 

The national government issued a 2018-2020 Plan for Public Servants (Carde) Training (1), it listed big data and AI as one of important tool that needs to be leveraged and taugt to public servants. There many different types of training were organized for public servants. 
For instance, Jinan City Big Data Bureau organized a data training program with Shandong University targeting public servants within the bureau but also targetting public servants who has data skill in other departments (2). The other example is from Zhejiang University who was commissioned by Shanxi Province Government to deliver training for 52 youth public servants from different level across government departments. (3) In addtion to above two types of training designed for a general purpose on understanding big data and how data might be used in theory ing overnance,  there are also training targeting specific group on specific topic. For instance the National Information Center organized a trainig session in the end of 2019 tagetting public servants who are in charge of data sharing platform across 29 provinces and 62 cities governments (4) on the topic of data sharing policy and platform management. 
There might also be quite technical training designed for public servants. One of example known to the public is one of Jingan District government department commissoned a research lab at Fudan university to deliver a 2-month training on big data policy but also specific technical tools and skills (5). But whether there are more training like this is a bit unknown through online search.

But there is no planned strategy or consistent training programs at either national level or local level. 

The national government issued a 2018-2020 Plan for Public Servants (Carde) Training (1), it listed big data and AI as one of important tool that needs to be leveraged and taugt to public servants. There many different types of training were organized for public servants. 
For instance, Jinan City Big Data Bureau organized a data training program with Shandong University targeting public servants within the bureau but also targetting public servants who has data skill in other departments (2). The other example is from Zhejiang University who was commissioned by Shanxi Province Government to deliver training for 52 youth public servants from different level across government departments. (3) In addtion to above two types of training designed for a general purpose on understanding big data and how data might be used in theory ing overnance,  there are also training targeting specific group on specific topic. For instance the National Information Center organized a trainig session in the end of 2019 tagetting public servants who are in charge of data sharing platform across 29 provinces and 62 cities governments (4) on the topic of data sharing policy and platform management. 
There might also be quite technical training designed for public servants. One of example known to the public is one of Jingan District government department commissoned a research lab at Fudan university to deliver a 2-month training on big data policy but also specific technical tools and skills (5). But whether there are more training like this is a bit unknown through online search.

CHN,China,Capabilities,CAPABILITIES,C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT,Capability (C): Open data initiative,Primary,C.CAPABILITIES.ODINIT,To what extent is there a well-resourced open government data initiative in the country?,1,justification,"Unlike most of countries operating open government data initiatives, China takes a bottom-up approach where more than 170 local governments actively publish open data and make new policies and laws on open data (1) while the national government itself has not yet launched open data portal and not released any nation-wide open data policy.

Regarding policy and legal frameworks, the fact is there is no nation-wide open data specific framework yet but local governments already made some efforts on making such frameworks. For instance, Guiyang is the pioneer in making the very first open data-related policy but Shanghai's local open data framework (2) sets out the foundation for other local governments to adopt and localize. At least, there are 8 local governments make such framework for open data but there are also more than 30 local governmnents has framework on governing public data or governemnt data which also include sections on open data.(1)

Usually the local commission for economy and informatizatiaon or the designated  Big Data Bureau is responsible for making the framework and enforcing it. The frameworks across china in common define open data as ""raw, reusable and machine readable data"" but categorize government data or public data into unconditonal open data, conditional open data and closed data which is significantly different from what is defined in the west (2). All local frameworks introduce mechanism to annually monitor and assess the implementation of open data across local departments but the level of enforcement varies

CHN,China,Capabilities,CAPABILITIES,C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT,Capability (C): Sub-national,Primary,C.CAPABILITIES.SUBNAT.e.e1.RULES,"1,2;Please provide evidence and a brief explanation that support your answer.",4,supporting,"China has made long-term efforts on data sharing covering wide range of practices including G2G, G2B, B2G and B2B.
First, about G2G, it is strongly encouraged to share data within government systems including within same department but also across departments in order to improve efficiency of governance and stimulate potential innovative uses. Since the introduction of Big Data to China in 2013, the Chinese government at national level pushes data sharing within gov with the release of Action Outline for Promoting the Development of Big Data (1) and the release of the Interim Measures for the Administration of Sharing of Government Information Resources (2). The G2G data sharing practice was dramatically improved and encouraged by the establishment of national government data sharing platform. By 2020, there are over 640K rows of and  1200 API listed on the platform. The data sharing services for particular verification or query purpose s(i.e. Verify identify of an individual based upon the input of name, ID num and phone num or query whether a given individual is married.) have reached over 0.175 billion times a month(3). At local level, Guizhou was the first local government making own local policy framwork on regulating public-sector data including a section on enforcing the data sharing within the government. Following Guiyang, local governments ranging from province-level to city or county-level made own policies on public-sector data. By 2020, at least 30 province-level governments  (total 34 in China) has such frameworks (4). In practice the movement of ""一网通办"" (all public service through one website) strongly accelerates the implementation of data sharing within gov and makes the impact and result of data sharing much more tangible.
Second, about G2B, the data flow from government to business is generally covered by open data policies in China. Especially after the redefinition of open data in 2019, the G2B data flow are well-covered by the local open data frameworks. Since 2021, as the national government defines data as the new production factor, data exchange (exchanging data product or service through free market) is also considered as a way to share government data in a form of product or service . In addition to open data framework, public-funded research data are shared with the public under the regulation on scientific data management(5). The national government also funds 20 scientific data sharing platform to share public-funded scientific data (6)
Third, B2G data sharing already took place in China and there is a new trend in setting a governance framework to well-govern such B2G data sharing practices and re-balance power shift to big platforms. In 2015, the national government issued an opinion on leveraging big data to strengthen the services and supervision over market entities (7). It was the first time the national government formally introduced a two-way data sharing principle instead of just one-way data sharing (G2B). In practice,  big e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and Meituan, or dock-less bike sharing platforms such as OfO or Mobike already shared own data with governments to fill in the gap of statistics (8) or help improve governance (9).
Finally, B2B data sharing already took practice but still lack strong governance framework. For a long term, B2B data sharing may occur in a grey zone and governments at all level took action especially after 2017-2018 period in enforcing law and shut down a lot of companies in sharing or selling data. New B2B data sharing models are under explored including data exchange ,data API and other methods. The action taken by government is to first strengthen the framework on data security in order to set the bottomline of what private sector can not do in terms of data sharing. The recent new laws such as data security law and new discussions on personal information protection as well as cross-border data sharing are all relevant to the B2B data sharing topic. Sector-specific guidance on B2B data sharing is also under exploration(10)

The national government, for the purpose of better managing information resources, has issued set of standard on managing informaiton resources especially on metadata and the creation of repository. 
Regarding with government data, there is no clear national framework yet but at local level or sector-level there are various level of maturity standards are currently in use or under development. There are also different level of methods of pushing forward the standaization. For instance Shanghai has created a city-level standard committee working on standards for public-sector data governance.

But there is no planned strategy or consistent training programs at either national level or local level. 

The national government issued a 2018-2020 Plan for Public Servants (Carde) Training (1), it listed big data and AI as one of important tool that needs to be leveraged and taugt to public servants. There many different types of training were organized for public servants. 
For instance, Jinan City Big Data Bureau organized a data training program with Shandong University targeting public servants within the bureau but also targetting public servants who has data skill in other departments (2). The other example is from Zhejiang University who was commissioned by Shanxi Province Government to deliver training for 52 youth public servants from different level across government departments. (3) In addtion to above two types of training designed for a general purpose on understanding big data and how data might be used in theory ing overnance,  there are also training targeting specific group on specific topic. For instance the National Information Center organized a trainig session in the end of 2019 tagetting public servants who are in charge of data sharing platform across 29 provinces and 62 cities governments (4) on the topic of data sharing policy and platform management. 
There might also be quite technical training designed for public servants. One of example known to the public is one of Jingan District government department commissoned a research lab at Fudan university to deliver a 2-month training on big data policy but also specific technical tools and skills (5). But whether there are more training like this is a bit unknown through online search.

The earliest policy document is the one issued in 2004 by the State Council on ""Advancing the re-use of information resources"" (1). Once entering into Big data era the state council's ""Action Plan for Advancing Big Data Industry"" in 2015 (2) marked the year where the Chinese government started the nationwide movement on pushing the re-use of data. Local governments such as Shanghai also released experimental and pioneering policy papers during the time of 2016-2021 on advancing the release and re-use of public data (3) as well as pushing forward the flow of private-sector data resources (4)

Actions are taken by governments to support and encourage data reuse include setting up a local government fund to stimulate the growth of the big data industry, setting up local gov grants to support innovative big data projects that re-use data, organizing local data competitions to reward activities re-using data especially for entrepreneurship. Some classic examples including Shanghai's SODA competition(5), Guiyang's Big Data Expo (6) and Beijing's Zhongguancun Big Data Alliance Forum (7) are tools employed by the government to advance the market.

A full comprehensive history of this term and how (difficult) it is implemented in China can be found at (1) , especially targeting foreign-invested company. 

With the new wave of re-forming the Securities Law (2) and Measures on Information Disclosure by Listed Companies(3), the requirement on disclosure of ""实际控制人"" (Actual Controlling Person) of listed companies is further strengthened. For instance the chapter 5 of Securities Law is specifically about informaiton disclosure and it makes clear that ""实际控制人"" (Actual Controlling Person) should be disclosed through its annual report and semi-annual report.

CHN,China,Availability,COMPANY INFORMATION,A.COMPANY.REG,Availability (CI): Company register,Primary,A.COMPANY.REG,To what extent is company information available as structured open data?,1,justification,"Company registration is managed in a hierarchical manner in China: most companies register locally while some companies may register at higher level government in order to obtaining special name such as having ""China"" in its company's name. Company register Information therefore is managed in a decentralized manner.

According to the Freedom Information Act (1) and Interim Regulation on Enterprise Information Disclosure (2), the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System was launched in 2014 to provide a one-stop website to allow anyone interactively to search and fetch information about companies in China. The system aggregates information held by local governments and it includes company basic registration information, any changes made to the company registration, any administrative fine made to the companies and 

However, the system does not support downloading or exporting any information, no matter a speicifci query result or bulk information, as structured data. There is also no official API provided to meet demands from the public. WIth the recent new efforts on building local open data portals, at least some local cities such as Dong Guan (3), Chengdu(4) and Qingdao(5) publish local company registration information in bulk as xls or json or API . There is no study yet provides a full picture about how many open data portals publish such data.

All land in China is owned by the state or by collectives. Under China's Land Administration Law (1), which was firstly drafted in 1986 and most recently amended in 2019.  the State owns all urban land, while farmer collectives own all rural land.The land ownership and land-use rights (LURs) is separated, and the state remains the land ownership and local government may transfer the LURs by laws on behalf of the state. Thus, private land ownership does not exist in China. 

In urban areas of cities, lands are state-owned, what can be assigned, sold and resold, leased or mortgaged is the right of using within a fixed term.There are two types of land-use rights in China: the ""granted land use right"" (requires payment) and the ""allocated land use right.""(for public interest without payment). The granted land use right is transferable by mortgage and lease, and may not be abrogated by the state except for compensation in the exercise of its right of eminent domain.

Lands in rural areas belong to peasants' collective ownership. A land-contracting tenure system is employed, called 'chengbao'(承包) in Chinese, according to Rural Land Contract Law promulgated in 2002. Land collectively owned by farmers may be contracted out to run by members of the collective economic organizations for crop farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries production under a term of 30 years.

In 2018 the government just conducted the third land survey and the result got cleaned and structured into a series of databases which is the national land database (2). Annually the government also use a hybrid methods combining  on-site investigation and remote sensing tech to conduct land change survey which is supposed to reflect the recent changes of land use or actual implements after land use planning/permission.(3)

The platform shares two types of data: one is the land survey result (2nd edition by 2007)  in digital image form providing 1:400 million resolution maps of land use. You can download a national map or province map with clear legends based upon the classification system (2nd edition though); the other type is the data based upon land survey(the 2nd edition conducted in 2007-2008) and land change survey (annually since 2009) in excel form. You can query the interactive system by selecting the province and year (2009-2016) to fetch data about the size of each type of land use in each city of the province. 
In addition to the data available on government website, there are also data available from gov-funded research institutions. For instance,Resource and Environment Science and Data Center under the Institution of Geo Science and Natural Resources Research , China Science of Academy publishes a series of  land use maps based upon Landsat 8 satellite Image data and human labelling. The data covers 10 editions reflecting land use in 1980, 1990, 1995,2000,2005,2010,2013,2015,2018 and 2020.

Result of public consultation should be disclosed by the related government agency or departments. There are two different ways of disclosing results: one is providing a summary with aggregated statistics on different types of suggestions and the whether take the suggestion or not. (3)(4)  are such typical examples ; another is disclosing every single comments received with associated responses (i.e. taking the suggestions or not). (5) is an example on Dongguan city's website listing 2 suggestions received from the public and the associated results of taking it or not.  
In addition to the public consultation process for proposed new regulation and laws, it is also common to disclose annual or five-year plan on law making. This process may also use public consultation to take suggestions from general publics on what new law or regulation should be made. (6)(7)
It is also noticed that in recent years, many local province or cities start making new regulations on public participation in law making. Through online search ""立法公众参与办法"", Shandong province, Zhuhai City, Lianyungang City, Guangzhou City, Hengshui City, and many others have such local regulation already in effective or currently under development. Such regulation empowers general public in participating the full lifecycle of law-making from planning to implementation and requires government bodies to disclose information on intention, public consultation process and its result. For instance, Guangzhou city's regulation Article 25 and 38 require that the government body should disclose the result of public consultation within 5 days after the deadline of the public consultation process (8)

Although the local government public procurement information are indexed on the webiste but more historical information can be found on  public procuremnt local portals. e.g Shanghai's portal is at http://www.ccgp-shanghai.gov.cn/ZcyAnnouncement/index.html

In addition to the central site  http://www.ccgp.gov.cn/  and local dedicated disclosure portals, local open data portals may also include a version of public procurement data on its website. The version can be historical and not up-to-date but compared to the disclosure portal the data is in machine-readable format as downlaodable json,xlsx, or csv. This can be tested on open data portals in cities like Shanghai (5),  Chengdu(6) and Shenzhen (7).

The latest report produced in 2019 followed the standard set by UNFCCC and covered six gases from energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture, land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and waste sector (1). The UNFCCC website also contains previous editions in 2004 and 2012 (2)

In addition to the data published by national communication, data on emission also calculated and published by third parties as academic or civil society's efforts. For instance, Carbon Monitor project(3) produced science-based estimates of daily CO2emissions in different countries including China. The data is freely and openly published online for re-use. Another relevant initiative called China Emission Accounts and Datasets(4) published data on China emissions at national level and local level (covering over 30 provinces,180 cities and over 2700 counties) based upon peer-reviewed estimations. 

The government itself also established internal system on reporting and monitoring emissions from key industry and factories. Based upon online research, the system is called ""碳排放数据报告与核查及排放监测计划"" and at least it is dated back to 2016. The system covers 8 important industry ranging from  Power to Steel to Aviation and requires reporting key factors and figures including fuel type, emission type, and amount of emission . The data however is not available publicly but perhaps could be requested through freedom of information.

Regarding birth information , there are two separate system moniotring birth: the hukou system requires birth registration to obtain legal identity though some people may hide new birth especially during the time that one-child policy was still in effective in China to avoid fines. The other system embedded into hospitals directly requires the reporting birth medical certification (3) and maternity information digitally through endpoint to a centralized system based upon a nation-wide standard(4) 
The birth data is not available online and it seems not possible to request detailed information though FOI as it contains personal privacy but aggregated data might be available through FOI request.

Specifically during the COVID-19 period,  some cities in China faced emergency of lacking enough healthcare resources for all potential patients thus cities such as Wuhan need to centralized coordinate healthcare resources and desinagte certain hospitals as special facilities for COVID-19 patients. Given this background, the city published information on its health commission website on a daily basis disclosing information on the capacity of each facilities, num of used bed and num of empty beds during the period of Feb 3rd to Feb 25th (1). After that period the government continuously published the data but for a different purpose as most designated hospitals now are no longer only serve COVID-19 patients but back to normal it is necessary to let general citizen understand which department of hospital back to normal and how many empty beds are available for non-COVID-19 patients (2). The data includes the name of facility, the departments back to normal ,num of empty beds and the percentage of beds in use .
For non-COVID practice, after online research it seems only few cities or hospitals start providing such information pulicly.
